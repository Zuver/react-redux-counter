# react-redux-counter
While learning Redux, I found myself frustrated by the apparent lack of simple Redux examples that are built on top of packages that 
I prefer to use (e.g. Webpack, Babel, and ESLint). 
So I made a barebones Redux starter kit that you're free to use if you like to JavaScript the same way that I do.

## How to run the project

1) `npm install`

2) `npm run start`
